# Unhandled Error in MongoDB Aggregation

This example demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: the lack of proper error handling.  The `toArray()` callback function should always include error handling to gracefully manage potential issues such as database connection problems or invalid aggregation pipelines.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases an aggregation pipeline without error handling.  If an error occurs during the aggregation process (e.g., a database connection error or an invalid pipeline stage), the application will likely crash without providing any meaningful error information.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors in MongoDB aggregation.  By checking for errors in the `toArray()` callback and logging or handling the error appropriately, the application can gracefully manage potential issues and prevent crashes.  Robust error handling is crucial for building stable and reliable applications.
